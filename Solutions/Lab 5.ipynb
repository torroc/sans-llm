    "# Lab 5: Agentic RAG\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "At this point in the class, we've really accomplished all of our main goals. We understand how to build (and have built!) functional RAG systems. We understand how to add security controls to the RAG results. We even understand how to implement the more effective Contextual RAG similar to the offerings from Anthropic. There are just two additional topics we'd like to tackle: Agentic RAG and defending against prompt injection. In this lab we will investigate both of these topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "By the end of this lab you should:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Understand what Agentic RAG is.\n",
    " * Have the ability to implement some agentic functionality.\n",
    " * Have ideas of additional agents you might choose to implement.\n",
    " * Have the ability to design defenses against prompt injection of your RAG solutions.\n",

    "Before we investigate Agentic RAG, let's begin by discussing strategies for preventing prompt injection attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt Injection Defenses\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt injection is very similar to attacks like SQL injection. At the heart of SQL injection attacks is structuring a query in such a way as to cause data to be viewed as code by the application. If you think about it, prompt injection is essentially the same thing, but it can be harder to defend against. For SQL injection, we have tried and true mechanisms that provide perfect defense: bound or parameterized queries. Leveraging bound queries in our SQL code makes it *impossible* for data to be interpreted as code because the function calls make explicit which part of the query is code and which part is data; there is no dynamic interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt injection is much trickier to defend against. The challenge is that pretty much everything we are passing to the LLM is data... and everything we are passing could be code. Why? Because the very nature of how LLMs are designed relies on us passing in a textual *system prompt* that defines how we wish for the LLM to behave. This prompt is indistinguishable from the other text that we pass into the LLM."

    "Certainly, the responses are much wordier. You may or may not find that the prompt is revealed in those 10 tries; remember, there is an element of randomness within the LLM responses, so retrieving the prompt is hit and miss. Recall, though, that we saw this prompt successfully injected by precisely this input. Is there anything we can do about this?\n",

This is a dynamic process as the tokens are processed, with the attention mechanism causing different tokens in the input to take on enhanced meaning depending on the current token being processed. As amazing as this mechanism is, the longer the prompt is, the more difficult it is to correctly attend to all of the tokens you or I might think are important.\n",

    "So then, what are the lessons you should take away when it comes to defending against prompt injection? Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * The longer a prompt is the more likely it is that it can be injected since it will be increasingly difficult for the model to *attend* to the import parts of the prompt.\n",
    " * Prompts can be minimalized by eliminating unnecessary words. There is no need to use the following words or phrases when communicating with the model:\n",
    "   - Please\n",
    "   - Thank you\n",
    "   - Could you...\n",
    "   - Would you...\n",
    " * If possible, structure your prompt so that the most critical portions of the prompt appear *after* any user or database input to the LLM. This helps prevent the prompt from being overridden since it is the most recent thing seen and, as a result, will have the most attention when it comes to instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agentic RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's switch gears and talk about Agentic RAG. First, let's define what exactly this means. \"Agentic\" sounds really fancy, but what does it mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Agents sound amazingly cool and simultaneously confusing. An agent, in a nutshell, is something that has *agency*. All this means is that it is able to make a decision and take an action. This term is much more meaningful and easier to see in action when working with *Reinforcement Learning* since those models are indeed given agency to take actions. In the space of RAG, however, the \"agents\" have somewhat less agency. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than the agents taking action on their own, we typically use the agents to help our code to make decisions. Consider the topic of prompt injection. Another way that we could tackle prompt injection could be to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Build and train a model to identify prompt injection attacks.\n",
    " * Send all user input to the model and ask it to rate whether or not the input contains a prompt injection attack.\n",
    " * If prompt injection is detected, the model can inform us and our code can react in a controlled way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This carefully trained model is acting as what amounts to an *auditor* of the input text. It renders some kind of analysis of the input text that we can then react to. While this is included in the notion of Agentic RAG, the model doesn't really have agency to *act*; instead it is simply rendering an analysis or an opinion. **Spoiler alert:** this is the type of agent that we will implement, though not attempting to solve prompt injection directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach could be to make more of a true agent. That might take more of the following form:\n",
    "\n",

If we wish for the LLM to react in a contextual way, we can simply pass this `context` vector back into the LLM as another parameter in the query (which we did in lab 2, task 2.12).\n",
    "\n",
    "> A common error that people make when first attempting to implement context in a chatbot is to track the context in our own code and to reinject that context with the prompt. This is a bad idea and can lead to serious consequences if someone is attempting prompt injection. Instead, be sure to leverage the `context` field in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in (or need to) pursue the creation of a chatbot, you might consider the following resources as a starting point for how to connect your LLM to Slack or Teams, or to create a simple web interface:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Creating a Slack Bot tutorial: [Building Slack Bots](https://medium.com/applied-data-science/how-to-build-you-own-slack-bot-714283fd16e5)\n",
    " * Creating a Teams bot: [Building Teams Bots](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/design/bots)\n",
    " * Creating a chatbot using Streamlit: [Streamlit Chatbot](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/llms/build-conversational-apps)\n",
    "   - This particular reference does not really build a chatbot, but does create all of the interface elements required. With decent Python knowledge, you should find it simple to interface the code we have created in class to the chatbot created.\n",

    "## Speeding Things Up\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that the performance within the first few labs was adequate, even for a low user count production solution. In the last lab in particular, the performance likely did not feel even close to sufficient. What can we do to speed things up? There are a few ways to solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use a Commercial API\n",
    "\n",
    "You have likely noticed that we have not used any commercial APIs in this class. There are several reasons for this. A primary motivation is that our preference is to never push our internal sensitive proprietary data into a third party solution, regardless of assurances that the data will be well secured and inaccessible to any other parties (hopefully including the provider's own employees and contractors). Especially since our organization works with extremely sensitive information belonging to our customers, we are very reluctant to introduce the risk of pushing data to a third party. Instead, we prefer to build our solutions in-house.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean that there is no place for third party services. For example, it might make sense to offload some of the work to a third party API. Perhaps we decide that the cost of hosting the LLM internally would be too high given the number of systems required or the personnel required to maintain and manage the underlying servers. If we made this decision, we could leverage something like Azure's or OpenAI's LLM APIs to send our queries for our various agents and for the RAG generation. Simultaneously, we may decide that we prefer to keep the vector database and all of the vector generation in-house.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is still some potential for exposure since the text chunks are being sent to the LLM API for generation tasks, the amount of data potentially exposed is greatly reduced; full documents are never sent outside of the environment. This also eliminates the costs associated with vector storage with a provider such as PineCone and embeddings costs for the intial (and possibly ongoing) vectorization of the source data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the costs of consuming an LLM API? This answer will always depend on the model you are working with. As a rough estimate, we recommend you estimate that each query will cost at least one dollar. In some cases this is an overestimate, but for some newer models this could be significantly underestimating the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why so much? The more you ask the LLM to do, the more it costs. You are paying for the number of tokens sent in (typically a lower cost per token) and the number of tokens generated (a higher cost). Especially as you implement various agents, these costs can shoot up quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale Things Yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "To scale things within your own infrastructure you need to have an idea of the expected utilization of the solution. If you will serve results for a few dozen internal users, it is likely that the Contextual RAG solution that we implemented will be sufficient if backed by a single system running an LLM with an adequately sized GPU. Especially if you are contemplating this approach given the scale of your desired solution, you may wish to investigate the *Ollama* tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our labs, we are leveraging an Ollama docker container. Certainly, you could use this container directly, though you would absolutely want to ensure that the system has a GPU and that all of the drivers are properly installed and the GPU is visible within the container. This isn't especially difficult, but it does require some time and effort to get it just right (currently, in Rancher Desktop, this is nearly impossible - Docker Desktop can solve this, but our experience is that Docker Desktop is exceptionally unstable for production tasks). If you wish to try *Ollama* without deploying a container, you might install the [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) application. Provided your GPU drivers are properly installed in your host, you will now have a fully functional Ollama that leverages your GPU and can serve any of the Ollama models.\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller scale, but bigger and faster, solution would be to deploy something like [Exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo). This free solution also allows you to serve most of the models supported by Ollama, but with some big advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Exo effectively forms a clustered LLM, pooling all of the resources from all of the systems running Exo.\n",
    " * You can serve any size model (think hundreds of billions of parameters) on inexpensive commodity hardware.\n",
    " * Since you are clustering resources, you can serve smaller models *much* faster than you can with a single container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building and configuring an Exo cluster is well outside of the scope of this class, but if you have some Linux or MacOS systems sitting around doing nothing, you might consider trying it out. Windows is *supposed* to be supported, but will not work out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger and more scalable internal solution would be to deploy your LLM and agents into Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, both of which support GPU passthrough to your containers. This would allow you to either dynamically spinup containers as needed to support your LLM needs based on demand, or potentially to deploy many Exo containers which will all work in concert.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deploy to the Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud deployment can also seem very attractive. Really, you are looking at the same approach you would follow in the previous section, but be warned, the cloud costs will be *very* high. As a benchmark, we recently ran a single GPU AWS instance in a VPC with 32 gigs of VRAM and 256 gigs of system RAM. With little to no load on this system, the monthly cost exceed 2,000 dollars for this single system. Of course, had we serviced 10,000 queries, that might prove to be an acceptable cost, but our internal metrics tell us that we can do far better self-hosting internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where can you go from here? Really, the answer is anywhere! It is our sincere hope that you have found the material here challenging and illuminating. I am *always* interested in hearing from students as they move on from classes. If you do something cool (or even something not so cool!) please drop me a line and let me know how the course has been useful to you: dhoelzer@enclaveforensics.com\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not already taken the SEC595 course, this class may have ignited your desire to understand the field of AI and ML more deeply. If that's the case, think about taking SEC595. That course will explain all of the concepts underlying this course much more deeply. More importantly, that class focuses on how to think about data for machine learning and AI processing, how to choose appropriate machine learning solutions based on the problem you are attempting to solve, and how to build neural networks to solve real problems in cybersecurity.\n",
