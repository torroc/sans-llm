    "# Lab 4: RAG: Attribution & Security\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "At this point, we have the basics of how to create a private LLM backed RAG solution using a vector database. There are still some outstanding tasks to improve this, however. First, how can we limit the information that the RAG will return based on user access rights? How can we get the model to provide attributions, or references, for the information that it returns? We also have concerns about how to defend our prompt, but we will address that more strongly in our final lab. We will also take a few minutes to discuss/demonstrate issues that can arise with different data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Have a Python class that can be used to simplify the construction and usage of your RAG solution.\n",
    " * Add the ability to generate attributions based on the source material for the RAG.\n",
    " * Have the ability to limit the information returned by the RAG based on user rights.\n",
    " * Add the ability to perform Contextual RAG.\n",
    "\n",

    "Before we jump into adding attribution and access controls, let's take some time to refine our RAG creation. Right now all of the pieces are spread out over multiple functions.

    "     * `chunk_overlap`, the number of characters the text splitter will overlap the chunks by.\n",
    "     * `embeddings_model`, the name of the `sentence-transformers` model to use for embeddings. Default to `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-distilbert-cos-v1`\n",

    "     * `llm_name`, the name of the LLM to use in the `llm_server`. Default to `llama3`, which we have already loaded into the container.\n",
    "   - Include the following minimum functionality:\n",
    "     * A `store_embeddings()` function that accepts a document (as returned by PyPDF) that will split the text, generate embeddings, and store the embeddings and chunks into the selected database and collection. All of this code is in the previous lab.\n",

    "## Adding Security\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine the problem of security from two perspectives. Our first perspective is ensuring the LLM will not generate answers using informaiton the user is not permitted to access. The second, which we will begin looking at in this lab and take a harder look at in the final lab, will be securing the entire RAG stack from prompt injection attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about how we can limit the information that the RAG/LLM stack can return to us. The way that a RAG works and given the type of prompt we are providing the LLM, generated text must (should) be generated based on the chunks of text provided from the vector search. It seems obvious, then, that the trick to limiting the results to only information the user should have access to is to limit the data that we prompt the LLM with.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tempting to try to fine tune the LLM with a notion of security and access controls. The intention would be to then include information about the access level of the user in the prompt and information about the sensitivity level of each chunk of data in the data used to fine tune the LLM. While this is *possible*, it is **very** risky. LLMs are notoriously easy to launch prompt injection attacks against, even with added controls. This translates to the real risk of people accessing information that they should not be able to.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Prompt Injection\n",
    "> *Prompt injection* occurs when the user attempts to convince the LLM to ignore the system prompt that is configured and behave in a way that is not intended. In the case that we are discussing currently, this could lead to an information disclosure. A public example of this is the efforts that people go to to convince public LLMs to reveal their internal names and system prompts, allowing the attacker to potentially leverage the LLM into generating content that the prompt specifically prohibits.\n",

In case you are unfamiliar with how this would work, it is as simple as adding up all of the rights that a user has and then using a logical AND to test to see if any of those rights match the classification(s) attached to a document.

    "It should be obvious that, while our example assigns a single classification to a document, a document can also be assigned a set of (sum of) rights so that it is accessible to multiple access levels. How can we do this with our vector store?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid or Filtered Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Most (if not all) vector database solutions support the ability to filter the vector search based on other criteria. This might be termed a *filtered* search or a *hybrid* search depending on the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Milvus, the solution we are using in our labs, supports this as a hybrid search. Adding this hybrid, or filtering, criteria requires us to add an `expr` term to our search. This expression is defined as some type of binary test (i.e., True/False). This can mean many things. For example, perhaps we are including something related to the generation date or ingestion date of the documents that our RAG is working with. If we wish to allow the user who is interacting with the RAG to confine results to information available in a certain date range, we could define an expression that evaluates whether the date in our metadata falls in the range of dates of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our specific case, access rights, we can create an expression that pre-filters the vectors returned based on the value of the `rights` metadata. We do run up against a technical constraint with Milvus, however. While the Milvus expression parser understands the bitwise AND operator (`&`), support for it has not yet been built out. Support for bitwise operations varies. All is not lost, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about access rights in terms of bits for a moment. Let's imagine we want to pre-filter the results in our query for a document requiring $2^5$, or 32, permissions. If a user has the right to view the data in this document what must be true? None of the user's permissions from $2^0$ through $2^4$ matter. Sure, the user might have them, but even if they had *all of those permissions*, the sum would be 31. If they have the right to view this document, their permissions must sum to *at least* 32. It is true that they might have the $2^6$ permission and not the $2^5$ permission, but it seems reasonable to use logic that says something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if user.rights > document.rights then return document\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do this in our database query, we can then post-filter the results with a bitwise check in the code in our class. Here's what this might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "result = self.database.search(collection_name=self.collection, \n",

    "                       output_fields=['text', 'publication', 'page', 'rights'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the `filter=f'{rights} >= rights'` argument. This is the piece that pre-filters the documents. Notice that we have also added our `rights` metadata field to the `output_fields` that we want returned. We could leverage these as illustrated in the following two lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "chunks = [i['entity']['text']  for i in result[0] if i['entity']['rights'] & rights]\n",
    "references = [(i['entity']['publication'], i['entity']['page']) for i in result[0] if i['entity']['rights'] & rights]\n",

    "Hmmm... That answer about the heap isn't awesome... We'll come back to that. Take a moment and consider how far we've come. We are now able to leverage the LLM to provide (usually) useful responses based on a specific body of text and user rights. Is there more we can do?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to improve the results even more, we could begin to experiment with larger and larger chunk sizes and chunk overlaps. We will begin to run into the programs raised at the outset, however. That is, we will begin to miss important information that could be very relevant just because it is embedded in the middle of a much larger chunk. There is, however, a way that we can get the best of both worlds.\n",

    "## Contextual RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "See if this makes sense to you; if we find a chunk of text (let's think of this as a sentence) that has a strong similarity with the question, the page that this text comes from should also be highly relevant. In fact, doesn't it seems that at a minimum the paragraph that sentence is from or the entire page is likely related to that concept? We can certainly have some misses, but this feels like a great intuition. Perhaps we would even want the text on the previous or following pages. How can we accomplish this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we are currently storing both the document and the page numbers for every chunk of text that we have stored. We take our initial results for a smaller set of nearby vectors and use these results to extract all of the text from specific pages in a document. Running the subsequent query is pretty simple, but we would have some work to do since the text chunks we have stored overlap each other. How can we compensate for this?\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach would be to attempt to programmatically identify the overlapping text and remove it, joining the resulting chunks back together. This is certainly achievable but will definitely require significant effort and testing. This is not as simple as removing a specific number of leading and trailing characters from each string because of how the recursive text splitter functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach would be to store the entire page of text alongside each chunk of text. This is easier, but clearly has a pretty high overhead for storage since we would be storing every page multiple times (once for each chunk of text from that page). It would likely be more performant than attempting to reconstruct the chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another approach that extends the last suggestion would be to generate an additional collection in the vector database (or some other document store) that stores the data as complete pages. We could even leverage this as an additional set of potential matches!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a simpler approach that we can take that leverages our existing RAG class. What if we use a somewhat larger `chunk_size` but set the `chunk_overlap` to zero? Now the initial suggested approach should work just fine since we simply need to reassemble the chunks with no additional processing to find the overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Subclassing or Monkey Patching\n",
    "> We want to add a contextual RAG query function to our class. Thusfar, we have redefined the entire class to accomplish changes. We can certainly continue to do this, but it might be simpler to \"Monkey Patch\" our class or to create a new class that inherits from our existing class.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> Now that we have assigned that function to the class, any instance of that class will also have access to that function. While this approach works well, it is not, perhaps, the cleanest approach. We can end up with difficult long-term troubleshooting and maintainability issues.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The altnernative, and likely better, approach is to create a subclass that inherits from the original class. For example:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> class ContextualRAG(RAG):\n",
    ">     def new_fun(self):\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a really big lab. We now have a state-of-the-art contextual RAG that operates in much the same way as RAGs from Anthropic and similar organizations. Certainly, there is more we can do to experiment and extend this contextual RAG, and we encourage you to do just that! We aren't going to take more time in the class for this, but clearly there is much more that can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you should feel confident in your understanding (and potentially, your ability to implement) an RAG or Contextual RAG solution from beginning to end. Certainly, there is work to do in terms of deployment and optimization. You are likely very well aware that the performance for this has been adequate for a single user, but the current deployment would not scale very well. Do not forget that the way we are deploying these containers is in a very generic way using Kubernetes, but absolutely no effort has been made to optimize the containers for anything other than size. Additionally, nothing has been done to leverage any underlying GPU hardware that might be available. While it is definitely possible to do this (and not that hard) in a full Kubernetes deployment, getting this working on the large variety of systems students might be using, and doing so under Rancher Desktop, is exceptionally challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get a good feel for how performant this type of solution can be without moving to a full deployment, consider doing the following as a personal project using a system with a modern nVidia (or other supported) GPU:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Install a Python environment that you are comfortable with.\n",
    " * Find and follow the directions for configuring GPU support for your system, operating system, and GPU.\n",
    " * Install the Ollama client for your operating system and configure it with the Llama 3, or any other, LLM on your host. Ollama will automatically leverage the GPU if you have properly configured the drivers for your OS.\n",
    " * Use a tool like Visual Studio Code to work with the Jupyter notebooks. Note that you will need to do reconfigure the notebooks to send queries for Milvus to your local host (127.0.0.1) since your notebooks will no longer be running in the Kubernetes containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "No doubt you will be impressed with just how much more performant this entire system is. Working with a Kubernetes (or similar) team in your infrastructure, you are now in a good place to deploy a full solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, also, why this solution is preferable to using the APIs offered by the various organizations selling LLM and AI API access. With these interfaces you are paying per token. Even just generating the vectors for our documents involves tens of thousands of tokens. Add to that the multiple queries into the vector store for something like a contextual RAG and the costs spiral very quickly. When we then try to scale this for hundreds or thousands of users, it can become cost prohibitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Added to this, we have the benefit that we control the entire ecosystem. We never had to send our potentially confidential information out to a third party, even just for tokenization. We also have very strong control over which information will be returned for users based on access levels, and adjusting how this performs can be accomplished relatively quickly by our development team."
