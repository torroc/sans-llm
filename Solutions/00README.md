# Solutions

The notebooks in this directory provide complete solutions to all of the lab exercises in the class. The recommended way to work through the labs is to work through the notebooks in the Labs directory, referring to these solutions as needed. If your Python skills need some work, you might prefer to begin by reading through the solution first, then working through the lab on your own.
